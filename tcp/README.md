# TCP/IP Client & Server

------------------------

# For `simple_rev_shell`:
## Open a terminal and start by running the Server:
### `clear && python3 ${pwd}/tcp_server.py ${host:string} ${portNumber:int}`

## Then open a separate terminal and run the Client:
### `clear && python3 ${pwd}/tcp_client.py ${sameHostAsServer:string} ${samePortAsServer:int}`

## Now you should be able to navigate the file system of the client machine (WITH PERMISSION OF COURSE)


# For `oop_rev_shell`:
## Open a terminal and start by running the Server:
### `clear && python3 ${pwd}/main.py ${host:string} ${port:int}`

## Then open a separate terminal and run the Client:
### `clear && python3 ${pwd}/src/client.py ${sameHostAsServer:string} ${samePortAsServer:int}`

## Now you should be able to navigate the file system of the client machine (WITH PERMISSION OF COURSE)
